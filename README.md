### Build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Run

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Test

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Development Mode

You can start the backend in development mode, this will automatically trigger a new build and reload the application
once the content of a file has been changed and you save the file.

Start two terminal windows and run:

`./gradlew build --continuous`

and in the other one:

`./gradlew bootRun`

If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:

`./gradlew build --continuous -xtest`

## API Endpoint Testing

### Postman

-   We highly recommend to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) in order to test your API Endpoints.

## Debugging

If something is not working and/or you don't know what is going on. We highly recommend that you use a debugger and step
through the process step-by-step.

To configure a debugger for SpringBoot's Tomcat servlet (i.e. the process you start with `./gradlew bootRun` command),
do the following:

1. Open Tab: **Run**/Edit Configurations
2. Add a new Remote Configuration and name it properly
3. Start the Server in Debug mode: `./gradlew bootRun --debug-jvm`
4. Press `Shift + F9` or the use **Run**/Debug"Name of your task"
5. Set breakpoints in the application where you need it
6. Step through the process one step at a time
